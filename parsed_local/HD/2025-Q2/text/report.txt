## THE HOME DEPOT, T, INC . NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)

## 1 . SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

## Basis of Presentation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements of The Home Depot , Inc . , together with its subsidiaries (the " Company , " " The Home Depot , " " Home Depot , " " we , " " our " or " us " ) , have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements . In the opinion of management , all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included . Results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results for the entire year . As a result , these consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our 2024 Form 10 -K . During the six months ended August 3 , 2025 , there were no significant changes to our significant accounting policies as disclosed in the 2024 Form 10-K .

## Receivables , net

The following table presents components of receivables , net:

| in millions          | August 3 , 2025   | February 2 , 2025   |
|----------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Card receivables     | $  1 , 287        | $  1 , 019          |
| Rebate receivables   | 1 , 485           | 1 , 404             |
| Customer receivables | 2 , 521           | 1 , 896             |
| Other receivables    | 585               | 584                 |
| Receivables ,  net   | $  5 , 878        | $  4 , 903          |

Card receivables consist of payments due from financial institutions for the settlement of credit card and debit card transactions . Rebate receivables represent amounts due from vendors for volume and co-op advertising rebates . Customer receivables relate to credit extended directly to certain customers in the ordinary course of business . The valuation allowance related to our receivables was not material to our consolidated financial statements at August 3 , 2025 or February 2 , 2025 .

## Supplier Finance Program

We have a supplier finance program whereby participating suppliers may , at their sole discretion , elect to receive payment for one or more of our payment obligations , prior to their scheduled due dates , at a discounted price from participating financial institutions . The payment terms we negotiate with our suppliers are consistent , irrespective of whether a supplier participates in the program , and we are not a party to the agreements between the participating financial institutions and the suppliers in connection with the program . We do not reimburse suppliers for any costs they incur for participation in the program , and we have not pledged any assets as security or provided any guarantees as part of the program . Our outstanding payment obligations under our supplier finance program were $598 million at both August 3 , 2025 and February 2 , 2025 and are recorded within accounts payable on our consolidated balance sheets , and the associated payments are included in operating activities within the consolidated statements of cash flows .

## Income Taxes

On July 4 , 2025 , the legislation commonly referred to as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (the " OBBBA " ) was signed into law in the U . S . , which includes a broad range of tax provisions , including the allowance to expense 100% of the cost of qualified property and immediate expensing of domestic research and experimental expenditures . While we continue to assess its implications , we do not expect the provisions of the OBBBA to have a material impact to our estimated fiscal 2025 effective tax rate . We expect a reduction in our fiscal 2025 cash tax payments due to the above mentioned provisions .

In fiscal 2024 , the Internal Revenue Service provided automatic income tax relief to taxpayers in certain southeastern states , extending the timeline to make certain tax payments . As a result , our fourth quarter fiscal 2024 estimated federal tax payment was deferred and paid in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 .

## Recent Accounting Pronouncements

We did not adopt any new accounting pronouncements during the six months ended August 3 , 2025 that had a material impact on our consolidated financial condition , results of operations , or cash flows . There have been no significant changes in accounting pronouncements not yet adopted as disclosed in the 2024 Form 10-K , and those not discussed in the 2024 Form 10 -K are either not applicable or are not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition , results of operations , or cash flows .

## 2 . SEGMENT REPORTING AND NET SALES

## Segment Reporting

The Company defines its segments based on how internally reported financial information is regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker ( " CODM " ) , our President and Chief Executive Officer , to analyze financial performance , make decisions , and allocate resources .

Primary Segment. t. We are engaged in retail operations and sell a wide assortment of building materials , home improvement products , lawn and garden products , décor products , and facilities maintenance , repair and operations products both in stores and online . We also provide a number of services , including home improvement installation services , and tool and equipment rental . We currently conduct these operations in the U . S . (including the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the territories of the U . S . Virgin Islands and Guam) , Canada , and Mexico , each of which represents an operating segment . For disclosure purposes , we aggregate these three geographic operating segments into one reportable segment (the " Primary segment " ) due to the similar nature of their operations and economic characteristics .

Other. r. As discussed in Note 10 , in June 2024 , we acquired SRS , a leading residential specialty trade distribution company across several verticals serving the professional roofer , landscaper and pool contractor through its branches located throughout the U . S . SRS is organized as three different lines of business: roofing and complementary building products , landscape , and pool . We have determined that each of these three lines of business represents an operating segment , none of which meets the thresholds prescribed under Topic 280 to be deemed a reportable segment . Therefore , results from our SRS operating segments are presented in " Other " beginning from the acquisition date of June 18 , 2024 .

Net sales presented in Other in the tables below relate to the sale of products by SRS , with roofing and related products accounting for approximately 62% and 63% of net sales in Other during the three and six months ended August 3 , 2025 , respectively , and approximately 65% during both the three and six months ended July 28 , 2024 .

Segment Information . Assets are reviewed by our CODM on a total company consolidated basis and not by segment . The accounting policies of our Primary segment are the same as those described in our summary of significant accounting policies .

The following table presents net sales , significant expenses , and operating income for our Primary segment:

Note: As disclosed in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the first quarter of fiscal 2025, we made changes that realigned certain product categories across our merchandising departments and major product lines within our Primary segment. As a result, prior-year amounts have been updated to conform with the current-year presentation. These changes had no impact on our consolidated net sales.

## Deferred Revenue

For products and services sold in stores or online , payment is typically due at the point of sale . When we receive payment before the customer has taken possession of the merchandise or the service has been performed , the amount received is recorded as deferred revenue until the sale or service is complete . Such performance obligations are part of contracts with expected original durations of typically three months or less . As of August 3 , 2025 and February 2 , 2025 , deferred revenue for products and services was $1 . 6 billion and $1 . 5 billion , respectively .

We further record deferred revenue for the sale of gift cards and recognize the associated revenue upon the redemption of those gift cards , which generally occurs within six months of gift card issuance . As of August 3 , 2025 and February 2 , 2025 , our performance obligations for unredeemed gift cards were $1 . 0 billion and $1 . 1 billion , respectively . Gift card breakage income , which is our estimate of the portion of our outstanding gift card balance not expected to be redeemed , is recognized in net sales and was immaterial during the three and six months ended August 3 , 2025 and July 28 , 2024 .

## 5 . DEBT AND DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

## Short -Term Debt

At the beginning of fiscal 2025 , we had a commercial paper program that allowed for an aggregate of $7 . 0 billion in borrowings , and was supported by $7 . 0 billion of back -up credit facilities . These backup credit facilities consisted of a five-year $3 . 5 billion credit facility scheduled to expire in July 2027 , a 364 -day $2 . 0 billion credit facility scheduled to expire in May 2025 , and a 364 -day $1 . 5 billion credit facility scheduled to expire in July 2025 .

In May 2025 , we terminated all three back -up credit facility agreements and simultaneously entered into a new five-year $3 . 5 billion credit facility scheduled to expire in May 2030 and a new 364-day $3 . 5 billion credit facility scheduled to expire in May 2026 .

In July 2025 , we increased our commercial paper program by $4 . 0 billion in connection with the anticipated financing of the acquisition of GMS (see Note 10) . In July 2025 , in connection with the increase in the commercial paper program , we also entered into a new three -year $3 . 0 billion back -up credit facility scheduled to expire in July 2028 , a new 364 -day $1 . 0 billion back -up credit facility scheduled to expire in July 2026 , and amended and restated our existing 364-day $3 . 5 billion credit facility to extend the maturity from May 2026 to July 2026 . In the aggregate , as of August 3 , 2025 , our commercial paper program allows for borrowings up to $11 . 0 billion and is supported by $11 . 0 billion of back -up credit facilities .

During the first six months of fiscal 2025 , all of our short term borrowings were under our commercial paper program , and the maximum amount outstanding during that period was $1 . 1 billion . At August 3 , 2025 , we had no outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper program or back -up credit facilities . At February 2 , 2025 , we had $316 million of outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper program with a weighted-average interest rate of 4 . 4% and no outstanding borrowings under our back-up credit facilities .

## Long-Term Debt

We did not have any new issuances of senior notes during the first six months of fiscal 2025 . In April 2025 , we repaid our $500 million 2 . 70% and $500 million 5 . 125% senior notes at maturity .

## Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

We use derivative instruments as part of our normal business operations in the management of our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates on certain debt . Our objective in managing these exposures is to decrease the volatility of cash flows affected by changes in the underlying rates and to minimize the risk of changes in the fair value of certain senior notes .

We had outstanding interest rate swap agreements with combined notional amounts of $5 . 4 billion at both August 3 , 2025 and February 2 , 2025 . These agreements are accounted for as fair value hedges that swap fixed for variable rate interest to hedge changes in the fair values of certain senior notes . At August 3 , 2025 and February 2 , 2025 , the fair values of these agreements totaled $599 million and $795 million , respectively , all of which are recognized in other long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets . All of our interest rate swap agreements designated as fair value hedges meet the shortcut method requirements under GAAP . Accordingly , the changes in the fair values of these agreements offset the changes in the fair value of the hedged long-term debt . At August 3 , 2025 and February 2 , 2025 , the carrying amount of our long-term debt , excluding current installments , subject to fair value hedges was $14 . 5 billion and $14 . 3 billion , respectively .

During the three and six months ended August 3 , 2025 , there was no new material hedging activity or material change to any other hedging arrangement disclosed in our 2024 Form 10-K , and all related activity was immaterial for the periods presented within this report .

Collateral . We generally enter into master netting arrangements , which are designed to reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty . To further limit our credit risk , we enter into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of certain derivative instruments exceeds or falls below contractually established thresholds . The cash collateral posted by the Company related to derivative instruments under our collateral security arrangements was $530 million and $668 million as of August 3 , 2025 and February 2 , 2025 , respectively , which was recorded in other current assets on our consolidated balance sheets . We did not hold any cash collateral as of August 3 , 2025 or February 2 , 2025 .

## Share Repurchases

In August 2023 , our Board of Directors approved a $15 . 0 billion share repurchase authorization that replaced the previous authorization of $15 . 0 billion , which was approved in August 2022 . The August 2023 authorization does not have a prescribed expiration date . As of August 3 , 2025 , approximately $11 . 7 billion of the $15 . 0 billion share repurchase authorization remained available . In March 2024 , we paused share repurchases and have not resumed share repurchase activity as of August 3 , 2025 .

## 7 . FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

The fair value of an asset is considered to be the price at which the asset could be sold in an orderly transaction between unrelated knowledgeable and willing parties . A liability ' s fair value is defined as the amount that would be paid to transfer the liability to a new obligor , rather than the amount that would be paid to settle the liability with the creditor . Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value are measured using a three -tier fair value hierarchy , which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value . The levels of the fair value hierarchy are:

- Level 1: observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
- Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices in active markets in Level 1 that are either directly or indirectly observable; and
- Level 3: unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists , therefore requiring management judgment to develop the Company ' s own models with estimates and assumptions .

## Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis

The following table presents the assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis:

| in millions                          | August 3 ,  2025  Fair Value (Level 2)   | February 2 ,  2025 Fair Value (Level 2)   |

The fair values of our derivative instruments are determined using an income approach and Level 2 inputs , which primarily include the respective interest rate forward curves and discount rates . Our derivative instruments are discussed further in Note 5 .

## Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis

Long-lived assets , goodwill , and other intangible assets are subject to nonrecurring fair value measurement for the assessment of impairment . We did not have any material assets or liabilities that were measured and recognized at fair value on a nonrecurring basis during the three and six months ended August 3 , 2025 or July 28 , 2024 .

## Other Fair Value Disclosures

The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents , receivables , accounts payable , and short -term debt approximate fair value due to their short -term nature .

## 9 . CONTINGENCIES

We are involved in litigation arising in the normal course of business . In management ' s opinion , any such litigation is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition , results of operations , or cash flows .

## 10 . ACQUISITIONS

## SRS Acquisition

On June 18 , 2024 , we completed the acquisition of SRS , a leading residential specialty trade distribution company across several verticals serving the professional roofer , landscaper and pool contractor , for total purchase consideration of $18 . 0 billion . We primarily used a combination of proceeds from commercial paper borrowings , the issuance of long-term debt , as well as cash on hand to fund the acquisition . In fiscal 2024 , we recorded a preliminary allocation of the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated acquisition date fair values . Measurement period adjustments recognized in fiscal 2025 were immaterial , and we finalized our purchase price allocation during the first quarter of fiscal 2025 .

## Pending GMS Acquisition

On June 29 , 2025 , we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire GMS , a leading distributor of specialty building products including drywall , ceilings , steel framing and other complementary products related to construction and remodeling projects in residential and commercial end markets across the U . S . and Canada . Under the terms of the merger agreement , we , through a wholly-owned subsidiary , made a cash tender offer to purchase all outstanding shares of GMS common stock for $110 per share , reflecting an expected total equity value of approximately $4 . 3 billion , and implying an expected total enterprise value (including net debt) of approximately $5 . 5 billion . The closing of the acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions , including the receipt of required regulatory approvals and the tender of a number of shares of GMS common stock representing a majority of the then-outstanding shares , and is expected to be completed in the second half of fiscal 2025 . The acquisition is expected to be funded through a combination of cash on hand and borrowings under our commercial paper program .

## Item 2 . Management ' s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations .

The following discussion provides an analysis of the Company ' s financial condition and results of operations from management ' s perspective and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this report and in the 2024 Form 10-K and with our MD&amp;A included in the 2024 Form 10 -K .

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

We reported net sales of $45 . 3 billion in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 . Net earnings were $4 . 6 billion , or $4 . 58 per diluted share . For the first six months of fiscal 2025 , net sales were $85 . 1 billion and net earnings were $8 . 0 billion , or $8 . 03 per diluted share .

During the second quarter of fiscal 2025 , we opened three new stores in the U . S . , resulting in a total store count of 2 , 353 at August 3 , 2025 . A total of 322 stores , or 13 . 7% , were located in Canada and Mexico . Our inventory turnover ratio was 4 . 6 times at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2025 , compared to 4 . 9 times at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2024 . The decrease in our inventory turnover ratio was primarily driven by higher average inventory levels during the first six months of fiscal 2025 .

We generated $9 . 0 billion of cash flow from operations during the first six months of fiscal 2025 . This cash flow , together with cash on hand , was used to fund cash payments of $4 . 6 billion for dividends and fund $1 . 7 billion in capital expenditures . In addition , we repaid $1 . 2 billion of longterm debt and repaid $316 million of net commercial paper borrowings . In February 2025 , we announced a 2 . 2% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $2 . 30 per share .

Our ROIC for the trailing twelve-month period was 27 . 2% at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2025 and 31 . 9% at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2024 . The decrease in ROIC was primarily driven by higher average long-term debt and higher average equity due to the financing of the SRS acquisition . See the Non -GAAP Financial Measures section below for our definition and calculation of ROIC .

## Pending GMS Acquisition

On June 29 , 2025 , we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire GMS , a leading distributor of specialty building products including drywall , ceilings , steel framing and other complementary products related to construction and remodeling projects in residential and commercial end markets across the U . S . and Canada . Under the terms of the merger agreement , we , through a wholly-owned subsidiary , made a cash tender offer to purchase all outstanding shares of GMS common stock for $110 per share , reflecting an expected total equity value of approximately $4 . 3 billion , and implying an expected total enterprise value (including net debt) of approximately $5 . 5 billion . The closing of the acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions , including the receipt of required regulatory approvals and the tender of a number of shares of GMS common stock representing a majority of the then-outstanding shares , and is expected to be completed in the second half of fiscal 2025 . The acquisition is expected to be funded through a combination of cash on hand and borrowings under our commercial paper program .

## Tariffs and Other Trade Policy Matters

We continue to monitor developments with respect to tariffs and other trade policy matters closely . We have worked , and continue to work , diligently to diversify our global supply chain . We believe our actions , such as these diversification efforts , along with our scale , vendor relationships , and experienced internal teams , position us to effectively manage the impact that tariffs in effect as of the date of this filing are expected to have on our business . We plan to continue to assess our sourcing strategy on an ongoing basis to maintain a strong value proposition for our customers .

As trade policy discussions and developments are ongoing , we cannot predict with certainty their ultimate impact on our business in future periods , including our results of operations and cash flows . For more information on these risks and uncertainties see Part I , Item 1A . " Risk Factors " of our 2024 Form 10 -K .

(2) Average ticket represents the average price paid per transaction and is used by management to monitor the performance of the Company, as it represents a primary driver in measuring sales performance.

## Sales

We assess our sales performance by evaluating both net sales and comparable sales . In fiscal 2025 , there is a one -week calendar shift as a result of the 53rd week in fiscal 2024 . For purposes of the following discussion , comparable sales , comparable customer transactions , and comparable average ticket are based upon the comparable 13-week period from fiscal 2024 .

Net Sales . Net sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 were $45 . 3 billion , an increase of 4 . 9% from $43 . 2 billion for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 . The increase in net sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 was primarily driven by SRS , which was acquired on June 18 , 2024 , and contributed $1 . 8 billion of incremental net sales during the second quarter of fiscal 2025 . Net sales also increased due to the impact of a positive comparable sales environment and sales from new stores , partially offset by the calendar shift which resulted in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 including one less week of spring and one additional week of summer .

Online sales , which consist of sales of products generated through websites and mobile applications , represented 15 . 6% of net sales during the second quarter of fiscal 2025 and increased by 10 . 1% compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2024 . Calculated on a comparable week basis relative to fiscal 2024 , online sales increased by 11 . 5% .

A stronger U . S . dollar compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2024 negatively impacted net sales by $163 million during the second quarter of fiscal 2025 .

Comparable Sales . Comparable sales is a measure that highlights the performance of our existing locations and websites by measuring the change in net sales for a period over the comparable prior period of equivalent length . Comparable sales includes sales at locations , physical and online , open greater than 52 weeks (including remodels and relocations) and excludes closed stores . Acquisitions are typically included in comparable sales after they have been owned for more than 52 weeks . Fiscal 2025 includes 52 weeks and fiscal 2024 included 53 weeks . For our calculation of comparable sales in fiscal 2025 , we will compare weeks 1 through 52 in fiscal 2025 against weeks 2 through 53 in fiscal 2024 . Comparable sales is intended only as supplemental information and is not a substitute for net sales presented in accordance with GAAP . The method of calculating comparable sales varies across the retail industry . As a result , our method of calculating comparable sales may not be the same as similarly titled measures reported by other companies .

Total comparable sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 increased 1 . 0% , primarily reflecting a 1 . 4% increase in comparable average ticket and a 0 . 4% decrease in comparable customer transactions compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2024 . Foreign exchange rates negatively impacted comparable sales by approximately 40 basis points for the quarter . Our comparable sales results reflect broader customer engagement with smaller home improvement projects , which was offset by the continued impact of macroeconomic uncertainties and other macroeconomic factors , including a persisting high interest rate environment pressuring large home improvement project demand .

During the second quarter of fiscal 2025 , our Storage &amp; Organization , Bath , Hardware , Building Materials , Indoor Garden , Electrical , Kitchen &amp; Blinds , Outdoor Garden , Millwork , Power , Plumbing , and Appliances merchandising departments within our Primary segment posted positive comparable sales compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2024 .

## Gross Profit

Gross profit for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 increased 4 . 9% to $15 . 1 billion from $14 . 4 billion for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 . Gross profit as a percentage of net sales , or gross profit margin , was 33 . 4% for both the second quarters of fiscal 2025 and 2024 , and reflects benefits from shrink and supply chain efficiencies within our Primary segment in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 , offset by the inclusion of SRS in our consolidated results for the full second quarter of fiscal 2025 .

## Operating Expenses

Our operating expenses are composed of SG&amp;A and depreciation and amortization .

(1) Customer transactions and average ticket measures do not include results from HD Supply or SRS.

(2) Average ticket represents the average price paid per transaction and is used by management to monitor the performance of the Company, as it represents a primary driver in measuring sales performance.

## Sales

We assess our sales performance by evaluating both net sales and comparable sales . In fiscal 2025 , there is a one -week calendar shift as a result of the 53rd week in fiscal 2024 . For purposes of the following discussion , comparable sales , comparable customer transactions , and comparable average ticket are based upon the comparable 26-week period from fiscal 2024 .

Net Sales . Net sales for the first six months of fiscal 2025 were $85 . 1 billion , an increase of 7 . 0% from $79 . 6 billion for the first six months of fiscal 2024 . The increase in net sales for the first six months of fiscal 2025 was primarily driven by SRS , which was acquired on June 18 , 2024 , and contributed $4 . 4 billion of incremental net sales during the first six months of fiscal 2025 . Net sales also increased due to the impact of a positive comparable sales environment and sales from new stores . Additionally , due to the 53rd week in fiscal 2024 , the first six months of fiscal 2025 included one less week of winter and one additional week of summer , which further contributed to the increase in net sales in the first six months of fiscal 2025 .

Online sales represented 15 . 6% of net sales during the first six months of fiscal 2025 and increased by 10 . 5% compared to the first six months of fiscal 2024 . Calculated on a comparable week basis relative to fiscal 2024 , online sales increased by 10 . 0% .

A stronger U . S . dollar compared to the first six months of fiscal 2024 negatively impacted net sales by $437 million during the first six months of fiscal 2025 .

Comparable Sales . Total comparable sales for the first six months of fiscal 2025 increased 0 . 4% , reflecting a 0 . 7% increase in comparable average ticket and a 0 . 5% decrease in comparable customer transactions compared to the first six months of fiscal 2024 . Foreign exchange rates negatively impacted comparable sales by approximately 55 basis points for the first six months of fiscal 2025 . Our comparable sales results reflect broader customer engagement with smaller home improvement projects , which was offset by the impact of macroeconomic uncertainties and other macroeconomic factors , including a persisting high interest rate environment pressuring large home improvement project demand .

During the first six months of fiscal 2025 , our Storage &amp; Organization , Indoor Garden , Building Materials , Electrical , Outdoor Garden , Appliances , Plumbing , Bath , Hardware , and Kitchen &amp; Blinds merchandising departments within our Primary segment posted positive comparable sales compared to the first six months of fiscal 2024 .

## Gross Profit

Gross profit for the first six months of fiscal 2025 increased 6 . 5% to $28 . 6 billion from $26 . 8 billion for the first six months of fiscal 2024 . Gross profit as a percentage of net sales , or gross profit margin , was 33 . 6% for the first six months of fiscal 2025 compared to 33 . 7% for the first six months of fiscal 2024 . The decrease in gross profit margin during the first six months of fiscal 2025 reflects the inclusion of SRS in our consolidated results for the full first six months of fiscal 2025 , partially offset by benefits from shrink and supply chain efficiencies within our Primary segment .

## Operating Expenses

Our operating expenses are composed of SG&amp;A and depreciation and amortization .

Selling, g, General &amp; Administrative . SG&amp;A for the first six months of fiscal 2025 increased $1 . 5 billion , or 10 . 7% , to $15 . 3 billion from $13 . 8 billion for the first six months of fiscal 2024 . As a percentage of net sales , SG&amp;A was 18 . 0% for the first six months of fiscal 2025 compared to 17 . 4% for the first six months of fiscal 2024 , which primarily reflects higher payroll and related costs during the first six months of fiscal 2025 along with the impact of a non-recurring legal-related benefit recognized during the first six months of fiscal 2024 within our Primary segment .

Depreciation and Amortization . Depreciation and amortization for the first six months of fiscal 2025 increased $177 million , or 12 . 4% , to $1 . 6 billion from $1 . 4 billion for the first six months of fiscal 2024 . As a percentage of net sales , depreciation and amortization was 1 . 9% for the first six months of fiscal 2025 and 1 . 8% for the first six months of fiscal 2024 , primarily reflecting increased intangible asset amortization expense related to SRS .

## Interest and Other, r, net

Interest and other , net for the first six months of fiscal 2025 increased $224 million , or 24 . 4% , to $1 . 1 billion from $917 million for the first six months of fiscal 2024 . As a percentage of net sales , interest and other , net was 1 . 3% for the first six months of fiscal 2025 compared to 1 . 2% for the first six months of fiscal 2024 , primarily due to higher long-term debt balances and lower interest income in fiscal 2025 , partially offset by lower commercial paper borrowings during fiscal 2025 .

## Provision for Income Taxes

Our combined effective income tax rate was 24 . 3% for the first six months of fiscal 2025 compared to 23 . 7% for the first six months of fiscal 2024 . The increase in our effective tax rate was driven by certain discrete tax benefits recognized during the first six months of fiscal 2024 .

## Diluted Earnings per Share

Diluted earnings per share were $8 . 03 for the first six months of fiscal 2025 , compared to $8 . 23 for the first six months of fiscal 2024 . The decrease in diluted earnings per share was primarily driven by lower net earnings during the first six months of fiscal 2025 .

## NON -GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

To provide clarity on our operating performance , we supplement our reporting with certain non-GAAP financial measures . However , this supplemental information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures . Non -GAAP financial measures presented herein may differ from similar measures used by other companies .

## Return on Invested Capital

We believe ROIC is meaningful for management , investors and ratings agencies because it measures how effectively we deploy our capital base . ROIC is a non -GAAP profitability measure , not a measure of financial performance under GAAP . We define ROIC as NOPAT, T, a non-GAAP financial measure , for the most recent twelve -month period , divided by average debt and equity . We define average debt and equity as the average of beginning and ending long-term debt (including current installments) and equity for the most recent twelve-month period .

The following table presents the calculation of ROIC , together with a reconciliation of NOPAT to net earnings (the most comparable GAAP financial measure):

|                            | Twelve Months Ended (2)   | Twelve Months Ended (2)   |
|----------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|

| NOPAT                      | $  16 , 412               | $  16 , 118               |
| Average debt and equity    | $  60 , 305               | $  50 , 534               |
| ROIC                       | 27 . 2 %                  | 31 . 9 %                  |

—————

(1) Income tax adjustment is defined as operating income multiplied by our effective tax rate for the trailing twelve months.

(2) The fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 includes 14 weeks. All other quarters include 13 weeks.

## LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

At August 3 , 2025 , we had $2 . 8 billion in cash and cash equivalents , of which $1 . 1 billion was held by our foreign subsidiaries . We believe that our current cash position , cash flow generated from operations , funds available from our commercial paper program , and access to the longterm debt capital markets should be sufficient not only for our operating requirements , any required debt payments , and satisfaction of other contractual obligations , but also to enable us to invest in the business , fund dividend payments , and fund any share repurchases through the next several fiscal years . In addition , we believe that we have the ability to obtain alternative sources of financing , if necessary .

Our material cash requirements include contractual and other obligations arising in the normal course of business . These obligations primarily include long-term debt and related interest payments , operating and finance lease obligations , and purchase obligations . In addition to our cash requirements , we follow a disciplined approach to capital allocation . This approach first prioritizes investing in the business , followed by paying dividends , with the intent of then returning excess cash to shareholders in the form of share repurchases . In March 2024 , we paused share repurchases in connection with the acquisition of SRS and do not have plans to resume share repurchases in fiscal 2025 .

On July 4 , 2025 , the OBBBA was signed into law in the U . S . , which includes a broad range of tax provisions , including the allowance to expense 100% of the cost of qualified property and immediate expensing of domestic research and experimental expenditures . While we continue to assess its implications , we expect a reduction in our fiscal 2025 cash tax payments due to the above mentioned provisions .

During the first six months of fiscal 2025 , we invested approximately $1 . 7 billion back into our business in the form of capital expenditures . In line with our expectation of approximately 2 . 5% of fiscal 2025 net sales , we plan to invest approximately $4 billion back into our business in the form of capital expenditures in fiscal 2025 . We expect to make these investments across initiatives to improve the customer experience , including through technology and development of other differentiated capabilities , to continue to mature and build out Pro customer capabilities , as well as to build new stores . However , we may adjust our capital expenditures to support the operations of the business , to enhance long-term strategic positioning , or in response to the economic environment , as necessary or appropriate . We may also utilize strategic acquisitions to help accelerate our strategic initiatives .

In February 2025 , we announced a 2 . 2% increase in our quarterly cash dividend from $2 . 25 to $2 . 30 per share . During the first six months of fiscal 2025 , we paid cash dividends of $4 . 6 billion to shareholders . We intend to pay a dividend in the future; however , any future dividend is subject to declaration by our Board of Directors based on our earnings , capital requirements , financial condition , and other factors considered relevant by our Board of Directors .

In August 2023 , our Board of Directors approved a $15 . 0 billion share repurchase authorization that replaced the previous authorization of $15 . 0 billion , which was approved in August 2022 . The August 2023 authorization does not have a prescribed expiration date . As of August 3 , 2025 , approximately $11 . 7 billion of the $15 . 0 billion share repurchase authorization remained available .

## DEBT

At the beginning of fiscal 2025 , we had a commercial paper program that allowed for an aggregate of $7 . 0 billion in borrowings , and was supported by $7 . 0 billion of back -up credit facilities . These back -up credit facilities consisted of a five-year $3 . 5 billion credit facility scheduled to expire in July 2027 , a 364 -day $2 . 0 billion credit facility scheduled to expire in May 2025 , and a 364 -day $1 . 5 billion credit facility scheduled to expire in July 2025 .

In May 2025 , we terminated all three back -up credit facility agreements and simultaneously entered into a new five-year $3 . 5 billion credit facility scheduled to expire in May 2030 and a new 364-day $3 . 5 billion credit facility scheduled to expire in May 2026 .

In July 2025 , we increased our commercial paper program by $4 . 0 billion in connection with the anticipated financing of the acquisition of GMS (see Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements) . In July 2025 , in connection with the increase in the commercial paper program , we also entered into a new three -year $3 . 0 billion back -up credit facility scheduled to expire in July 2028 , a new 364 -day $1 . 0 billion back -up credit facility scheduled to expire in July 2026 , and amended and restated our existing 364-day $3 . 5 billion credit facility to extend the maturity from May 2026 to July 2026 . In the aggregate , as of August 3 , 2025 , our commercial paper program allows for borrowings up to $11 . 0 billion and is supported by $11 . 0 billion of back -up credit facilities .

During the first six months of fiscal 2025 , all of our short term borrowings were under our commercial paper program , and the maximum amount outstanding during that period was $1 . 1 billion . At August 3 , 2025 , we had no outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper program or back -up credit facilities , and we were in compliance with all of the covenants contained in our back-up credit facilities , none of which are expected to impact our liquidity or capital resources .

We also issue senior notes from time to time as part of our capital management strategy . We did not have any issuances of senior notes during the first six months of fiscal 2025 . In April 2025 , we repaid our $500 million 2 . 70% and $500 million 5 . 125% senior notes at maturity .

The indentures governing our senior notes do not generally limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness or require us to maintain financial ratios or specified levels of net worth or liquidity . The indentures governing our notes contain various customary covenants; however , none of the covenants are expected to impact our liquidity or capital resources . We were in compliance with all such covenants at August 3 , 2025 . See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our debt arrangements .

## CASH FLOWS SUMMARY

## Operating Activities

Cash flow generated from operations provides us with a significant source of liquidity . Our operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from our customers , offset by cash payments we make for products and services , associate compensation , operations , occupancy costs , and income taxes . Cash provided by or used in operating activities is also subject to changes in working capital . Working capital at any point in time is subject to many variables , including seasonality , inventory management and category expansion , the timing of cash receipts and payments , vendor payment terms , and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates .

Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $1 . 9 billion in the first six months of fiscal 2025 compared to the first six months of fiscal 2024 , primarily due to changes in working capital . Changes in working capital were primarily driven by increased inventory levels during the first six months of fiscal 2025 along with the deferral of our fourth quarter fiscal 2024 estimated federal tax payment to the first quarter of fiscal 2025 .

## Investing Activities

Net cash used in investing activities decreased by $17 . 2 billion in the first six months of fiscal 2025 compared to the first six months of fiscal 2024 , primarily resulting from cash paid to acquire SRS in fiscal 2024 .

## Financing Activities

Net cash used in financing activities in the first six months of fiscal 2025 primarily reflected $4 . 6 billion of cash dividends paid , $1 . 2 billion of repayments of long-term debt , and $316 million of net repayments of commercial paper borrowings . Net cash provided by financing activities in the first six months of fiscal 2024 primarily reflected $10 . 0 billion of net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt and $2 . 5 billion of proceeds from commercial paper borrowings , net of repayments , which were used to finance the SRS acquisition . This was partially offset by $4 . 5 billion of cash dividends paid , $1 . 3 billion of repayments of long-term debt , and $649 million of share repurchases prior to pausing share repurchases in March 2024 .

## CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

During the first six months of fiscal 2025 , there were no changes to our critical accounting estimates or our significant accounting policies as disclosed in the 2024 Form 10 -K . Our significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements .

## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

For information on accounting pronouncements that have impacted or may materially impact our consolidated financial condition , results of operations , or cash flows , see Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements .

## Item 3 . Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk .

Our exposure to market risk results primarily from fluctuations in interest rates in connection with our long-term debt portfolio . We are also exposed to risks from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our foreign operations into U . S . dollars and on the purchase of goods by these foreign operations that are not denominated in their local currencies . Additionally , we may experience inflation and deflation related to our purchase and sale of certain commodity products . During the first six months of fiscal 2025 , there have been no material changes to our market risks from those disclosed in the 2024 Form 10-K .

## Item 4 . Controls and Procedures .

Under the direction and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer , we evaluated our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) and concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of August 3 , 2025 .

We are in the process of an ongoing business transformation initiative , which includes upgrading and migrating certain accounting and finance systems . We plan to continue to migrate additional business processes over the course of the next few years and have modified and will continue to modify the design and implementation of certain internal control processes as the transformation continues .

Except as described above , there were no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended August 3 , 2025 that have materially affected , or are reasonably likely to materially affect , our internal control over financial reporting .

## Item 1 . Legal Proceedings .

There were no material changes during the first six months of fiscal 2025 to our disclosure in Part I , Item 3 . " Legal Proceedings " of our 2024 Form 10 -K .

SEC regulations require us to disclose certain information about proceedings arising under federal , state or local environmental regulations if we reasonably believe that such proceedings may result in monetary sanctions above a stated threshold . Pursuant to SEC regulations , the Company uses a threshold of $1 million for purposes of determining whether disclosure of any such proceedings is required . Accordingly , below we have provided an update regarding the civil consent decree we entered into with the U . S . Department of Justice , the U . S . Environmental Protection Agency (the " EPA " ) , and the states of Utah , Massachusetts , and Rhode Island in April 2021 .

As previously reported , including in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 , the decree required certain changes to lead -safe work practices in our installation services business and provided for stipulated penalties for failure to perform by third-party installers . In the second quarter of fiscal 2025 , we made the final payment of stipulated penalties owed under the decree , and we are now working with the EPA to terminate the decree . The aggregate amount of stipulated penalties paid to the EPA under the decree totaled approximately $1 . 7 million , and we have collected fines from our third -party installers for the approximately $1 . 7 million paid .

## Item 1A . Risk Factors .

(1) These amounts reflect deemed repurchases pursuant to our Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan, as Amended and Restated May 19, 2022 (the "Plan"). Under the Plan, participants surrender shares as payment of applicable tax withholding on the vesting of restricted stock. Participants in the Plan may also exercise stock options by surrendering shares of common stock that the participants already own as payment of the exercise price. Shares so surrendered by participants in the Plan are repurchased pursuant to the terms of the Plan and applicable award agreement and not pursuant to publicly announced share repurchase programs.

(2) On August 14, 2023, our Board of Directors approved a $15.0 billion share repurchase authorization that replaced the previous authorization of $15.0 billion, which was approved on August 18, 2022. The August 2023 authorization does not have a prescribed expiration date. As previously disclosed, we paused share repurchases in March 2024 and have not resumed share repurchase activity as of August 3, 2025.

(3) Excludes excise taxes incurred on share repurchases.
